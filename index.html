        <h1>I'm Ryan Gannon, a software engineer.</h1>
        <h2>There <em>may</em> be more content here soon.  In the meantime...</h2>
        <h3>Who are you?</h3>
        <p>Like I said above, I'm Ryan.  I write code as a hobby, and for a living.</p>
        <h3>What kind of code do you write?</h3>
        <p>The expressive, bug-free kind.</p>
        <h3>...</h3>
        <p>I mean, I like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>functional programming (as a tool in my belt, not as a dogma)</li>
            <li>free (as in freedom!) and open source software</li>
            <li>little tools that make my everyday easier</li>
            <li>Backend development</li>
            <li>Microservices, though I'm fairly new to them, their appeal and utility are obvious</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>That's more like it.  What languages do you know?</h3>
        <p>English, but I've learned French and Russian in the past, I could probably pick them back up if I needed to.</p>
        <h3>What about programming languages?</h3>
        <p>In no particular order (except for Common Lisp, it's my favorite):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Common Lisp</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Kotlin</li>
            <li>Rust</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Go</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>Bash</li>
            <li>Perl</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Is that it?</h3>
        <p>No, but learning new languages is one of my favorite things, so I've at least played around with lots of them, and am eager to learn more.</p>
        <h3>Where did you go to school?</h3>
        <p>I went to RIT, in Rochester, New York.  They saw fit to give me a B.S. in Computer Science, with a minor in Free and Open Source Software and Free Culture.</p>
        <h3>Can I see your code?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/IAmRasputin">Sure.</a>  Keep in mind though, that most of the code I'm proud of is, unfortunately, proprietary.</p>
        <h3>Why is your site so ugly?</h3>
        <p>Because it's pure HTML.  I'm a developer, not a designer.  I want to add CSS eventually, I think.</p>
        <h3>Why not use a static site generator like Hugo?</h3>
        <p>I tried a few, nothing did it for me.  This seemed like fun.</p>
        <h3>Was it?</h3>
        <p>Kinda?  Might need to juice vim to auto-close tags, or just use a Common Lisp -> HTML compiler so I don't have to hurt myself hitting the angle-bracket keys.</p>
        <h3>You're cool and we want to hire you, can we see your resume?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately (for you), I'm currently gainfully employed and not looking to rock the boat for a little while, but feel free to <a href="mailto:ryanmgannon.dev@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>.</p>
